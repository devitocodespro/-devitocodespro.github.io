title: DevitoPRO getting HIP with AMD INSTINCT
subtitle: 'Devito Codes announces new partnership with AMD'
description: >-
  Devito is a popular open-source DSL for coding performance portable code in
  Python using symbolic computation for evolving. While previously Devito only
  supported AMD GPUs using OpenMP offloading, thanks to a recent partnership
  with AMD, DevitoPRO now also generates optimized HIP directly.

[Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org) is a domain-specific Language (DSL) and code generation framework for the design of highly optimized finite-difference kernels for use in simulation, inversion, and optimization. Devito utilizes a combination of symbolic computation and compiler technologies to automatically generate highly optimized software for a wide range of computer architectures.

Previously Devito only supported AMD GPUs using OpenMP offloading. Thanks to Devito Codes' new partnership with AMD, we quickly adapted our existing CUDA support to achieve a substantial uplift in performance, achieving competitive levels of performance with comparable architectures. 

This is exciting news for our users who use Devito in high-performance computing and data-intensive applications, including seismic imaging (Fig 1) and medical imaging (Fig 2).

Devito is easy to use and reduces the development time of high-performance code from months to days. While performance is invariably critical once the software goes into production, the overwhelming feedback from the academic and industrial user communities is that reducing cycle time has the greatest material impact on business.
