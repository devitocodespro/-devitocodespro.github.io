At Devito Codes, we take pride in fostering collaborations that push the
boundaries of technological innovation. Our ongoing work with
[S-Cube](https://www.s-cube.com/) exemplifies how synergy between companies can
drive advancements in computational science.  Through this collaboration, we
have harnessed our strengths in developing high-productivity, accurate, and
performance-portable wave propagators using DevitoPRO, while S-Cube has
developed several cutting-edge algorithms for seismic imaging, such as [XWI
(X-Wave Full Waveform Inversion)](https://www.s-cube.com/). XWI boasts superior
predictive power, enabling more accurate subsurface models in complex geological
settings.  Implementing these innovative algorithms on top of the DevitoPRO
framework ensures they are performance-portable across all major CPUs (ARM64 and
x86_64) and GPUs (AMD/HIP, Intel/SYCL, Nvidia/CUDA), providing complete
flexibility and efficiency in diverse computational environments.

#### Enhancing Wave Propagation Technology

Devito Codes has consistently delivered state-of-the-art solutions for wave
propagation problems, emphasizing productivity and accuracy. Our operators are
designed to be performance-portable, ensuring they can run efficiently on all
major CPU and GPU platforms. This flexibility is crucial in the dynamic
landscape of computational geophysics, where adaptability to different
computational environments is vital for optimizing time-to-solution,
price-to-solution, and as a means to overcome hardware supply constraints.

In collaboration with S-Cube and AWS, we benchmarked DevitoPRO operators on a
wide range of AWS SKUs so price performance could be accurately estimated before
running any seismic imaging processes. This enabled S-Cube to optimize the
efficiency of seismic workloads on AWS.

DevitoPRO is also enabling S-Cube to quickly develop the next generation of
elastic wave solvers to extend their existing state-of-the-art seismic imaging
algorithms. Rapid innovation in these areas is essential to improving the
accuracy and efficiency of characterizing complex geological formations. We
achieve performance-portability and accelerated innovation in seismic data
processing by combining DevitoPRO code generation capabilities with S-Cube’s
innovative inversion algorithms.

#### The Power of Collaboration

Working together, Devito Codes and S-Cube have demonstrated that collaboration
can lead to breakthroughs that would be challenging to achieve independently.
Our joint efforts have resulted in a suite of tools that enhanced S-Cube
capabilities and brought DevitoPRO to a wider range of companies.

- **Innovation**: Integrating DevitoPRO into S-Cube’s seismic imaging algorithms has led to accelerated innovation in the development of new methodologies that improve the accuracy of subsurface imaging.
- **Performance**: By leveraging our performance-portable operators, S-Cube’s algorithms can run on a variety of hardware platforms, making advanced seismic imaging techniques more accessible.

#### Achievements Through Partnership

The collaboration between Devito Codes and S-Cube is a testament to what can be
achieved when companies work together towards a common goal. It underscores the
importance of combining expertise from different domains to tackle complex
challenges. This partnership has not only enhanced our technological offerings
but also provided valuable insights that will guide future developments.

At Devito Codes, we are committed to continuing our work with a diverse range of
service companies, cloud vendors, and hardware providers. Our goal is to ensure
that our solutions remain at the forefront of innovation, providing our clients
with the tools they need to succeed in an ever-evolving industry.

By fostering such collaborations, we aim to contribute to the advancement of
computational science and its applications in geophysics and beyond. The success
of our partnership with S-Cube is a clear indication that, working together, we
can achieve remarkable results and drive the field forward.
