This week at ISC 2024 in Hamburg, we are thrilled to introduce SYCL code
generation support for DevitoPRO, specifically optimized for Intel's Data Center
GPU Max 1100 and 1550. This advancement, developed in collaboration with Intel,
extends our OpenMP offloading support in open-source Devito and provides a
robust SYCL capability essential for delivering high-performance for seismic
imaging workloads on Intel GPUs.

SYCL is a versatile C++-based parallel programming framework that facilitates
code portability across diverse computing architectures including CPUs, GPUs,
and FPGAs from various vendors. The integration of SYCL into DevitoPRO means
users can now deploy their existing Devito applications on Intel GPUs
effortlessly, only needing to specify a different target architecture allowing
just-in-time compilation to reap the performance benefits of SYCL.

This update empowers DevitoPRO users with true performance portability across
all major CPU and GPU vendors.

#### Overview of Devito and DevitoPRO

**Devito**: A robust, open-source Python-based DSL and compiler, Devito
capitalizes on high-level symbolic definitions to produce optimized
finite-difference computational kernels across multiple CPU and GPU platforms.
Developed initially at Imperial College London in collaboration with the SLIM
group at GaTech, Devito supports MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC, parallel programming
models providing a high-productivity solution for both academic and commercial
applications.

**DevitoPRO**: Serving primarily the energy sector, DevitoPRO is an enhanced
commercial version of Devito designed for maximizing performance portability in
seismic imaging. With the new addition of SYCL code generation for Intel GPUs,
DevitoPRO now offers greater adaptability across GPU platforms from all leading
vendors.

#### New Features in DevitoPRO

We continuously refine our code generation through iterative benchmarking
against manually optimized codes. This process ensures DevitoPRO not only
matches but frequently surpasses the performance of hand-tuned implementations
across various GPUs. The new SYCL integration allows for seamless switching
between target backends, ensuring application consistency and performance across
different architectures. Thanks to Intel's support, we've also incorporated
an Intel GPU Max 1100 into our development cluster to boost our testing and
optimization capabilities.

#### Benefits for Users

Devito and DevitoPRO provide high-level abstractions that shield developers from
the complexities of porting and optimizing code across different GPU platforms.
For HPC specialists, Devito also offers the capability to tweak the generated
code, offering further customization. This strategy significantly cuts
development time and avoids vendor lock-in, granting users genuine flexibility
in their hardware choices.

#### Open Source Contributions and OpenMP Support

The open-source iteration of Devito includes OpenMP support for Intel GPUs,
broadening its usability across various research and development applications.
Our vibrant community on Slack and GitHub is instrumental in continually
enhancing Devito, ensuring it stays at the cutting edge of computational science
for simulations, inversions, and optimizations based on finite differences.

#### Conclusion

The introduction of SYCL code generation in DevitoPRO marks a crucial
advancement in our mission to deliver high-performance, high-productivity
computing solutions across major CPU and GPU platforms. We value and encourage user
feedback to further refine and evolve our technologies.
