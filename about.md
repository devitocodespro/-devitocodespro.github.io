Paul Holzhauer is responsible for developing the business strategy for Devito Codes, Ltd. Previously he developed and led the Nvidia Oil and Gas Team to help the industry and geoscientists to do more science for the 13 years prior to joining Devito Codes, Ltd.  Paul has spoken around the world at conferences on the application of GPU technology to extracting value from seismic data in order to reduce uncertainties, to improve the accuracy of reservoir predictions, and to mitigate the risk associated with expensive drilling and production activities. Prior to Nvidia, he held various positions at AMD, Halliburton, EDS, and a few startups, as well as working 15 years at Sun Microsystems, all spent developing the oil and gas market. He began his career as an ALC programmer for a utility company, and thereby quickly understood the potential value of computing. He holds a B.S. in Quantitative Mathematics from the University of Houston.
