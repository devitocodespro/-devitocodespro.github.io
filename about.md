style="margin:0px 50px 50px 50px"/> Gerard has more than 20 years experience in
high performance computing, research software development, numerical modeling,
inverse problems, code generation and compilers. Gerard is also a Professor of
Computational Science and Engineering and Director of the Applied Computational
Science and Engineering MSc programme in the Department of Earth Science and
Engineering, Imperial College London. 

## Fabio Luporini, CTO and co-founder

<img src="/assets/img/profile_Fabio.jpg" alt="Fabio Luporini" align="left"
style="margin:0px 50px 50px 50px"/>Fabio has a PhD in
Computer Science from Imperial College where he worked on compiler
technologies for mathematical modeling software - specifically floating
point reduction algorithms and data locality optimizations for
finite-elements within the open source software Firedrake. Fabio is the lead
software architect of Devito and has more than a decade of experience working on
the boundaries between computer science, high-performance computing and
mathematical modeling.

## Paul Holzhauer, Director of Business Development and Strategy and co-founder

<img src="/assets/img/profile_Paul.jpg" alt="Paul Holzhauer" align="left"
style="margin:0px 50px 50px 50px"/> Paul Holzhauer is responsible for developing
the business strategy for Devito Codes, Ltd. Previously he developed and led the
Nvidia Oil and Gas Team to help the industry and geoscientists to do more
science for the 13 years prior to joining Devito Codes, Ltd.  Paul has spoken
around the world at conferences on the application of GPU technology to
extracting value from seismic data in order to reduce uncertainties, to improve
the accuracy of reservoir predictions, and to mitigate the risk associated with
expensive drilling and production activities. Prior to Nvidia, he held various
positions at AMD, Halliburton, EDS, and a few startups, as well as working 15
years at Sun Microsystems, all spent developing the oil and gas market. He began
his career as an ALC programmer for a utility company, and thereby quickly
understood the potential value of computing. He holds a B.S. in Quantitative
Mathematics from the University of Houston.

## Mathias Louboutin, Senior Solution Architect

<img src="/assets/img/profile_Mathias.png" alt="Mathias Louboutin" align="left"
style="margin:0px 50px 50px 50px"/> Mathias has a Ph.D. from the Georgia
Institute of Technology. Previously, he worked as a research scientist in the
Seismic Laboratory for Imaging and Modelling (SLIM). During that time, he was
the lead developer of the open-source software JUDI (Julia Devito Inversion
framework). He has more than a decade of experience working on scalable and
portable open-source software for the exploration geophysics and inverse
problems. Mathias's research includes large-scale PDE-constrained optimization,
finite-difference solver, non-linear and non-convex optimization with recent
extensions to medical imaging, and cloud-native high-performance computing
(AWS, GCP, and Azure).

Mathias has been a critical figure in developing the open-source Devito
framework since the beginning. As Senior Solution Architect, he continues to
develop Devito and DevitoPRO to create state-of-the-art solutions in exascale
HPC, machine learning, DSLs, PDE-constrained optimization (e.g., subsurface
imaging), and cloud computing. 

## Edward (Ed) Caunt, Research Scientist

<img src="/assets/img/profile_Edward.jpg" alt="Edward Caunt" align="left"
style="margin:0px 50px 50px 50px"/>Edward "Ed" Caunt is an erudite research
scientist with a penchant for diving deep into seismic wavefields and their
representation in numerical models. He recently completed his PhD at Imperial
College London, his dissertation focused on the "Generalised Immersed Boundary
Methods for Finite-Difference Geophysical Wavefield Modelling". This seminal
work delved into the challenges posed by topography in wavefield modelling on
finite-difference grids. Through a blend of abstraction and automation, he
formulated a method to tackle these challenges, culminating in the development
of a software framework, Schism, which automates the process of devising
immersed boundaries.

Ed's journey in geophysics began with a first-class MSci degree at Imperial
College London. His final year project shed light on the optimization of
stencils for wave modeling in Devito. His various research stints include an
internship at TGS, a research assistant at Imperial College where he worked on a
mantle-scale tomographic model, and a significant contribution as a Graduate
Teaching Assistant for programming and continental tectonics. 

Ed's research interests span seismic imaging, finite-difference methods,
boundary conditions, wavefield modeling, and full-waveform inversion (FWI). His
multidisciplinary approach to geophysics and computational science has
positioned him as a valuable asset to the Devito Codes Ltd. team.
