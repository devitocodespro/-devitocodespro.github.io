Computer Science from Imperial College where he worked on compiler
technologies for mathematical modeling software - specifically floating
point reduction algorithms and data locality optimizations for
finite-elements within the open source software Firedrake. Fabio is the lead
software architect of Devito and has more than 8 years experience working on
the boundaries between computer science, high-performance computing and
mathematical modeling.

### Paul Holzhauer, Director of Business Development and Strategy and co-founder

<img src="/assets/img/profile_Paul.jpg" alt="Paul Holzhauer" align="left"
style="margin:0px 50px 50px 50px"/> Paul Holzhauer is responsible for developing
the business strategy for Devito Codes, Ltd. Previously he developed and led the
Nvidia Oil and Gas Team to help the industry and geoscientists to do more
science for the 13 years prior to joining Devito Codes, Ltd.  Paul has spoken
around the world at conferences on the application of GPU technology to
extracting value from seismic data in order to reduce uncertainties, to improve
the accuracy of reservoir predictions, and to mitigate the risk associated with
expensive drilling and production activities. Prior to Nvidia, he held various
positions at AMD, Halliburton, EDS, and a few startups, as well as working 15
years at Sun Microsystems, all spent developing the oil and gas market. He began
his career as an ALC programmer for a utility company, and thereby quickly
understood the potential value of computing. He holds a B.S. in Quantitative
Mathematics from the University of Houston.
